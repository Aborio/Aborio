### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Full Stack Developer, this world is new to me, but with my previous work experiences, I can bring new skills to this path. 
I am very interested more in the Back end, and my idea is to be able to professionalize myself in the back end, and then to be able to advance in that until reaching the security of a company, and to be able to provide a correct and safe operation of the web pages.

FULL STACK DEVELOPER - Coderhouse y SoyHenry (2021-
Currently)
During this career of more than 4000 hours of practices (can be corroborated in my GitHub) weeks I learned how to create a website with the best practices of 
responsive web design, working with HTML and CSS. Also, how to program with JavaScript
and I discovered the functionalities of the React JS framework.
At the end of the Back End Programming module, I will learn how to develop modern applications with Node.js and 
applications with Node.js and MongoDB. In addition, how to program in JavaScript on the server side, applying asynchronous techniques, and how to work with SQL and NoSQL databases, 
to master data management.
